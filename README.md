# 1D_opencl_generic
Generic tutorial and host code walkthrough for opencl kernels with 1D inputs and outputs

This repo is to give users a general idea of how to write opencl host as well kernel code for 1D array operations. There is a basic 1D Array template inside the "1D_Template" folder and the same style of writing host code and kernel code has been used to prepare the two other examples.
